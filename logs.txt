4/24: bug discovered: floating point error in intersection computation causes breakpoint computations to behave erratically, destroying the beachline

BST invariant is sometimes broken; breakpoint not being deleted properly on circle event

Circle event error: circle events being processed when they don't actually occur, min example 4 points with circle event of top three points being the last potential event (and does not occur) - fixed

Sphere implementation: attempt at using beachline approach failed because the necessary systems of equations could not be solved in a reasonable amount of time for simple test points (did not terminate at all) - sympy wasn't fast enough using spherical coordinates, cylindrical coordinates, or rectangular coordinates (not even the algebraic equation could be solved for the last)

Solution: instead use the projection algorithm Voronoi diagrams on the sphere (Na, Lee, Cheong)
